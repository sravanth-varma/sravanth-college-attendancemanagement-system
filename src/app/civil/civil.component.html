<p class="lead alert alert-success" role="alert">Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]</p>

   <pre> Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines.</pre>
 <p class="lead alert alert-danger" role="alert">It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.<br>

    Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environment, mechanics and other fields.

    Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. Knowledge was retained in guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads, and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.[5]
    
    One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of Archimedes in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of buoyancy, and practical solutions such as Archimedes' screw. Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.</p>

<h3>Civil Engineering</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p> The Civil Department has firmly stood as one of the colossal pillars of the college, it greatly cares for its students to make them efficient and competent enough in the field of Civil Engineering and their related concerns as professionals. The Department of Civil Engineering at VJIT is established in 2013 and in the very few years of existence has established itself as an inspiring learning center. The Department has continuously upgraded itself in terms of academic performance, research and infrastructure as required by the curriculum and the requirements based on industrial need as a result of which our students have been able to develop potential strengths to meet the professional and personal challenges prevailing and who can serve in all the possible positions of their respective job domains and contribute towards a holistic growth. The Department is transforming to a great extent with the diversity that comes with interfacing with other technology domains. The highly qualified faculty team inspires students to do research and train them to address the societal problems while trying to produce responsible, competent engineers who can take a lead in nation-building.</p>
