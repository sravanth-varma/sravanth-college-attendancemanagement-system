<p>Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering physics, engineering mathematics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines.

    The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.</p>
   <p> Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.</p>

<h3>Mechanical engineering</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Mechanical Engineering involves the design, analysis, and manufacture of a wide variety of mechanical components and systems and has been on an integration phase with other disciplines for the past few decades offering many challenging career opportunities for the students. The Department of Mechanical Engineering at VJIT was established in 1999 and is accredited by NBA in 2010 and Re-accredited in the year 2018 for 3 years. The mechanical engineering curriculum is diverse because it is central to many modern industries and also because individual mechanical engineers may be employed in a wide range of engineering endeavors from initial research and development of a product to manufacturing and marketing. Between these diverse activities, mechanical engineers integrate engineering sciences, conceptual product design and manufacturing capabilities into a cost-effective, quality products. Going by the technological advances the Department has been actively engaged in transforming the teaching, learning methodology and creating a sound knowledge base in the minds of students. Innovative Teaching tools, Hands on Workshops, Community projects and Industry Internships are given priority in the department to groom the students industry ready.</p>
